<p>This blog kept records of projects I've ever done, ideas to be explored, and thoughts of a wondering mind in its prime. </p>

<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>Programming, psychology, piano&violin, reading&writing, along with many other great things fulfill my days and nights. I once got lost in career decisions - with a major in Automation, a minor in Entrepreneurship, and a master's in Computer Science, even a CFA level 1 passed record. Yet now I've recognized the importance of focus and craftmanship. All the complex skills and knowledge I've learned would form the shoulder to stand on someday, but the mission for my 20's would be climbing on one ladder, higher and deeper, and then would come the time to boom the firework.</p>

<p>Please have a look of my Github profile. A good percentage of the projects are in the fields of computer graphics, which was my graduate focus, in OpenGL/Unity, along with other interesting topics like computer vision, web application etc. Feel free to comment and advice.</p>
